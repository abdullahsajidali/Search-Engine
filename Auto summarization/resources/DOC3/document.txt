					   Changes in the Family

Changes in our society in recent years have weakened family life. First of all 
today’s mothers spend much less time with their children. A generation ago most 
houses got by on Dad’s paycheck and Mom stayed home. Now many mothers work 
and their children attend an after school program stay with a neighbor or go home 
to an empty house. Another change is that families no longer eat together. In the 
past Mom would be home and fix a full dinner –salad pot roast potatoes and 
vegetables with homemade cake or pie to top it off. Dinner today is more likely to 
be takeout food or TV dinners eaten at home or fast food eaten out with different 
members of the family eating at different times. Finally television has taken the 
place of family conversation and togetherness. Back when there were meals 
together family members would have a chance to eat together talk with each other
and share event of the day in a leisurely manner. But now families are more likely to 
be looking at the TV set than talking to one another. Many homes even have several 
TV sets which people watch in separate rooms. Clearly modern life is a challenge to 
family life.
